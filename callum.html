        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Callum — a nerd, a softie, a chronic overthinker, and a guy who somehow 
            got lucky enough to meet a girl who makes everything feel lighter.  
            I like tech, games, music, and pretending I'm not blushing when she compliments me.  
            I’m sarcastic, loyal, and apparently very huggable (according to her).

    <section class="section fade">
        <h2>What I Love</h2>
        <p>
            I love deep conversations, late-night calls, stupid jokes,  
            and the feeling of being understood.  
            I love making people laugh, even if it’s at my own expense.  
            And most of all, I love the girl who somehow makes me feel  
            like the best version of myself without even trying.

        <p>
            I don’t know how she puts up with me,  
            but I’m grateful every single day that she does.  
            She makes me better without even trying,  
            and I hope I make her feel even a fraction of what she makes me feel.
