        <h2>How Beautiful She Is</h2>
        <p>
            Summer is the kind of pretty that stops you for a second. 
            Not just her face, but the way she smiles, the way she talks, 
            the way she lights up a room without even trying.

        <h2>What She Means to Me</h2>
        <p>
            She means comfort, excitement, softness, and home. 
            She’s the person I want to talk to first, the one I think about 
            when something good happens, and the one I want to protect 
            when things get hard.
