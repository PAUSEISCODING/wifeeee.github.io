        <h2>Why She’s Beautiful</h2>
        <p>
            She’s the kind of beautiful that doesn’t fade. 
            The kind that makes you stare for a second too long. 
            The kind that makes everything else feel a little less important.

        <h2>What She Means to Me</h2>
        <p>
            She means comfort, excitement, softness, chaos, and home.  
            She’s the person I want to tell everything to.  
            She’s the one I think about when I wake up and the one I miss before I fall asleep.
