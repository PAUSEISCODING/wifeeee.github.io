        <h2>Why She’s Beautiful</h2>
        <p>
            She’s the kind of beautiful that doesn’t fade. 
            The kind that makes you stare for a second too long. 
            The kind that makes everything else feel a little less important.

        <h2>What She Means to Me</h2>
        <p>
            She means comfort, excitement, softness, chaos, and home.  
            She’s the person I want to tell everything to.  
            She’s the one I think about when I wake up and the one I miss before I fall asleep.

        <p>
            I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but I’m grateful every single day.  
            You make my life softer, brighter, and so much better just by being in it.  
            I’m lucky in a way I still don’t fully understand — lucky that you exist,  
            lucky that I met you, and luckiest of all that you chose me.  
            I love you, Summer. More than I ever say out loud.
